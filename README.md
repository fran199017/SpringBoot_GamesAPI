# SpringBoot_GamesAPI (In process)
After having gathered some experience, I am working on making an API from scratch with data insertion in a H2 database.

##Index
http://localhost:8080/index

##H2 Database
http://localhost:8080/h2-console
###Credentials database
- url: jdbc:h2:mem:mydb
- user: sa
- password:


##Steps
1. You need register or nav button (you can invent credentials)
2. Login with email and password.
3. Select role (in process).
4. You can try too see users, videogames or only a game pressing on card.
